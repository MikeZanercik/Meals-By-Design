# [MealsByDesign](https://mealsbydesign.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
MealsByDesign is an application for those who want to create structure in their grocery and spending habits on food. It corresponds to the following user story:

> AS A person with a hectic schedule of many commitments,
> 
> I WANT to organize what I'm eating for the week ahead of time,
> 
> SO THAT I can buy the necessary groceries to make my meals and avoid overspending on food by constantly eating out.

This interactive, mobile-responsive application addresses a problem of our choosing but at minimum, it required the use of
- A Node and Express server
- A MySQL database and the Sequelize ORM
- RESTful API routes for retrieving and adding new data
- Deployment via Heroku (with seed data)
- A 3rd party web API (new to the team)
- A CSS framework other than *Bootstrap*
- The MVC paradigm (Model-View-Controller)

**MealsByDesign** is a collaborative creation from the minds of [Christie](https://github.com/TwoByteKitty), [Laurie](https://github.com/lbernadel), [Mike](https://github.com/MikeZanercik), and [Thomas](https://github.com/thoughtsinflight).

## Challenges
- Creating the user login/signup feature with authentication
- Figuring out how to associate our database models
- Making sure to properly follow the MVC structure
